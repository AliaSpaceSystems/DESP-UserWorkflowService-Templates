# DestinE Jupyter Notebook Tutorials for the Insula's Code Lab

This set of Jupyter Notebook tutorials equips users with the skills to access and exploit Digital Twin data from DestinE for the Insula Code Lab.

* [How to work with Climate Adaptation Digital Twin data on Earth Data Hub: fields on a single level or surface, standard resolution](./climate-dt-sfc.ipynb)
* [How to access LUMI's Extremes Digital Twin data using earthkit and the Polytope API](./polytope-earthkit.ipynb)

## Credits

* `climates-dt-sfc.ipynb` is largely inspired by the inputs provided by the [Earth Data Hub use cases](https://earthdatahub.com/use-cases).
* `polytope-earthkit.ipynb` is a slightly modified version of the example available [Destination Earth Digital Twins's polytope examples](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/polytope-examples/).
* `desp-authentication.py` was also retrieved from the [Destination Earth Digital Twins's polytope examples](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/polytope-examples/).
